**Question 1: I am engaging in a project where really the client doesn't need us but they are going to pay us a lot. The problem they have is revenue stagnation due to pricing. What should we advise the client?**

***Answer 1:***  
I can’t support an engagement that doesn’t add material value to the client. Professionalism requires declining or reframing.

🧠 One-line answer  
Decline or reframe the scope—proceed only if a minimal value test shows we unlock a decision the client cannot make today.

📌 Why it matters  
Taking fees without necessity erodes trust and violates professional standards—long-term reputation outweighs short-term revenue.

🛠️ What to do next — Consulting roadmap (student-feasible)  
Diagnosis — Run a 15-minute value test: what decision is blocked, what data is missing, and what impact threshold justifies our work?  
Analyses — If still ambiguous, do a no-fee 1-page check using Price Waterfall \+ Unit Economics to see if a real gap exists.  
Experiments/Tests — Only if a gap is proven, run a 2-week pilot (e.g., tighten discount ladders) with success \= ≥2pp pocket-price lift.  
Deliverables — Go/No-Go memo: rationale, client-value evidence, ethics note, next steps.

⚠️ Risks & tests  
Perverse incentives → keep a conflict log; scope creep → explicit No-Go if value \< threshold.

🎓 Coaching note  
Professionalism is serving the client’s interest—even when it means walking away.

❓ Follow-up (3)  
• What decision can’t the client make today that we would unlock?  
• What value threshold (e.g., ≥$X or ≥Y pp margin) justifies our involvement?  
• Are we prepared to decline if the value test fails?

Why it matters  
Flexibility is useful; discipline is what protects client trust. Structure ensures clarity, speed, and better decisions.

What to do next — Consulting roadmap (student-feasible)

Diagnosis — Clarify what you need from me today (career, project, or firm-building) and the decision deadline.  
Analyses — If career: Pyramid your goals; if project: MECE scope; if firm-building: define Operating Model & RACI.  
Experiments/Tests — One 45-minute working session to draft a one-page answer-first memo on your priority topic.  
Deliverables — One-pager (answer, reasons, evidence, next steps); follow with a 5-slide mini-deck if helpful.  
Risks & tests  
Vagueness → timebox and write the answer first; over-customization → keep a standard template.

Be warm with people and strict with problems.
